I would call the [Computer Science program at the University of Illinois](http://www.cs.illinois.edu/) one of a classical school of thought. We weren't taught web design, Python, or C# and instead were taught traditional languages along with the skills required to succeed in a wide variety of positions (I understand I'm not doing a good job of selling the program, but that post will come). Some of these skills include being resourceful and applying things we learn to projects that excite us.

A little bit ago, [a video by Ilya Grigorik](https://plus.google.com/+IlyaGrigorik/posts/Ev7RHf7GGTk) was posted to [r/programming](http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/) about rendering pages with mobile built in mind. The time to glass is crucial for a good user experience. In developing this page, I'm making sure to apply the principles described in the video. Though I'm learning how to do this whole web design thing, and I guess I've been learning through many forays, I should make sure I have a solid design direction in mind.
