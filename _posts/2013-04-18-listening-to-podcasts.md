So I've started listening to podcasts using [DoggCatcher](http://www.doggcatcher.com/). As with every purchase (big or small), I did lots of research into which podcast app I wanted to use for this new hobby. Ultimately, I chose DoggCatcher because of the support provided by the developer and the fact that I could download the lite version and only pay $2.99 to upgrade to the full version. I'm going to guess the introductory price is no longer available and my timing was just perfect.

Over the past couple years, I've dabbled with streaming music services: Grooveshark, Rdio, Slacker Radio, and Spotify were ones that were particularly memorable. However, I always found myself questioning the monthly fee and how much I was actually using the service. I liked the ability to cache stations or songs on my phone in order to reduce data consumption or for cases of limited service, like on an airplane. That being said, I'm now storing a bunch of podcasts on my phone and these include many categories, not just music.

## What am I currently subscribed to?
