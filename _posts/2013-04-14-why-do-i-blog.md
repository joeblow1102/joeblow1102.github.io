The same thing will happen to this blog as ones before it. I will get excited about writing, but inevitably, the blog will go untouched and unmaintained. The question I should ask myself is "Why do I blog?" I've come up with some answers to this and other related questions in parts.

## Why do I do anything?
It is a pretty vague question, and the answer I give will probably be insufficient, but I enjoy doing things that challenge me or force me to learn something new. Some examples from my past: Why did I learn Dvorak? Why did I start actively managing my money (with both short and long-term goals)? (When did I start putting one space after punctuation instead of two?)

Most of my hobbies have come from the "hey, wouldn't it be cool if I tried this?" mentality. I learn best by doing - a lesson will be truly hammered home when I can experience it for myself. In other words, I will never start writing in a blog again unless I just start writing in a blog.

## What am I learning from this blog?
* This blog is hosted on [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/). It's my first project outside of work to utilize Git.
* I'm forcing myself to learn [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). (I know there are other static html generators and formatting syntax, but the integration of GitHub Pages, Jekyll, and Markdown is awesome).
* I've done all of the development for this project online. I started with [Prose](http://prose.io) and have moved on to [Cloud9](http://c9.io). (I've been interested in getting a Chromebook for quite some time and I'm exploring how much of my workflow can be done in a browser window).

## Other reasons
* My previous blog was hosted on [Posterous](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterous) and they're going kaput on April 30th. I had to retrieve my posts and files from blog posts and move my web presence somewhere else.
* My first personal website was self-written in PHP on a free host somewhere. Since then, I've used [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/) (self-hosted and not) and then moved to Posterous for a more web-friendly hosted solution. The thing I liked about Posterous over other platforms was its tight integration with email. The GitHub Pages/Jekyll/Markdown solution is reliable, web-friendly, and will allow me to poke at code.

All of this is why I've started blogging again. Let's see how long I stick with it this time....
